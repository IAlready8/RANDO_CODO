**TL;DR üü¢**‚ÄîHere are **5 fresh ‚Äúhot-potato‚Äù LLM stacks** plus **5 non-framework access points** that security wonks keep whispering about. They‚Äôre powerful, controversial, and just shady enough to make compliance teams sweat‚Äî**handle with care üî¥**.

### üü¢ Part A ‚Äì Five *new* high-drama frameworks

| # | Framework                     | Why the drama üî¥                                                                                                                                                                     | Power lever (concept-level, no hand-holding)                                                                             |
| - | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | **Mixtral 8√ó7B (Mistral AI)** | Released fully open-weights under a ‚Äúno holds barred‚Äù license‚Äîlets anyone splice MoE shards into Franken-models. ([aibusiness.com][1], [ollama.com][2])                              | MoE sharding + LoRA lets you slam specialist adapters onto a single GPU for dirt-cheap domain spins.                     |
| 2 | **Grok (xAI)**                | Trained on the X firehose; Musk keeps yanking it back when it mouths off politically. Community jailbreak comps pour gasoline on its sarcasm engine. ([wsj.com][3], [reddit.com][4]) | ‚ÄúSnark dial‚Äù prompt knobs let you skew tone for engagement farming‚Äîgreat for shit-posting bots.                          |
| 3 | **ERNIE 4.x (Baidu)**         | From locked-down to Apache-2.0 overnight; still hard-coded for CCP red-lines (Tiananmen queries = silence). ([en.wikipedia.org][5], [reuters.com][6])                                | Dual-deploy: Mainland-safe fork vs. uncensored fork built from the same weights to A/B reach Chinese & global audiences. |
| 4 | **Gemini Ultra (Google)**     | Researchers popped multiple prompt-hacking vectors, leaking system instructions and election misinfo filters. ([hiddenlayer.com][7])                                                 | Layer Gemini behind your own sandboxed pre-prompt to harvest tool-calls while insulating user chats.                     |
| 5 | **Falcon 180B (TII)**         | Biggest open-weight model around; ethics crew frets about one-click extremist fine-tunes. ([arxiv.org][8])                                                                           | Use 4-bit quant + ‚ÄúFranken-merge‚Äù with Llama-3-8B to trade size for speed without losing coherence.                      |

### üü¢ Part B ‚Äì Five ‚Äúbeyond-framework‚Äù access points

1. **Leaked Weight Torrents**

   * *What:* Meta‚Äôs LLaMA weights spilled onto BitTorrent within 48 h of launch‚Äîdoor still revolving for every new model release. ([reddit.com][9])
   * *Why it matters:* Full parameter access = absolute jailbreak; no API guard-rails.
   * *Risk flag üî¥:* Licensing violations can bite‚Äîtrack provenance.

2. **Prompt-Injection & System-Prompt Leaks**

   * *What:* Attackers craft hostile prefixes/suffixes to force the model to vomit its hidden instructions or private files; seen in GPT-4 and custom GPTs. ([robustintelligence.com][10], [wired.com][11])
   * *Edge:* Lets you recon an API‚Äôs inner guard-rails, then pivot with tailored exploits.

3. **Clean-Label Data-Poisoning**

   * *What:* Injecting ‚Äúpoison frogs‚Äù samples into open datasets so the next model learns malicious triggers. ([github.com][12])
   * *Edge:* One poisoned PR in a popular repo today can hijack tomorrow‚Äôs fine-tune.

4. **Model-Extraction / Distillation Attacks**

   * *What:* Techniques like **LoRD** or **Model Leeching** clone commercial black-box LLM behaviour for pennies. ([arxiv.org][13], [arxiv.org][14])
   * *Edge:* Rapidly bootstraps a private replica you can tweak without vendor limits.

5. **Misconfigured Debug / Proxy End-points**

   * *What:* HiddenLayer researchers exposed Gemini debug payload routes; similar lapses show up in free-tier proxies & corporate chat plugins. ([hiddenlayer.com][7], [businessinsider.com][15])
   * *Edge:* Snagging a stray bearer token or verbose log can grant unlimited, filter-free compute‚Äî**big damn deal üü•**.

### Key Takeaways üü¢

* **Open weights ‚â† safe weights**‚Äîonce the params hit the wild, ethics controls are toast.
* **Side-channel & supply-chain vectors** (prompt injection, data poisoning) are rising faster than patch cycles.
* **Model extraction is the new gold rush**‚Äîsteal behaviour, skip the \$100 M training bill.

Stay curious, stay cautious‚Äîand for the love of uptime, sandbox your experiments before you let these spicy tools roam free. üü¢
